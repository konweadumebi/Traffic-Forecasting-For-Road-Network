### Description of the "Transport for London Road Network" Dataset

The "Transport for London Road Network" (TLRN) dataset provides comprehensive information about the roads within the Transport for London (TfL) network. This dataset includes various attributes that detail the characteristics and metadata of each road segment. Below is a detailed description of the features included in this dataset:

1. ### TOID (Topographic Identifier)
   - Description: A unique identifier assigned to each road segment in the dataset. This identifier is essential for referencing and distinguishing between different road segments.

2. ### Road Name
   - Description: The name of the road. This feature provides the commonly recognized name used for the road segment, which can be useful for navigation and location purposes.


3. ### Road Class
   - Description: A classification that indicates the road's importance or type within the network. Road classes may include designations such as A roads, B roads, or local roads, each representing different levels of traffic flow and road capacity.


4. ### Road Type
   - Description: Describes the physical characteristics of the road, such as whether it is a primary route, secondary route, or another type. This information can be used to understand the road's design and intended usage.


5. ### TLRN Date
   - Description: The date when the road segment was incorporated into the Transport for London Road Network. This provides historical context for when the road became part of the TfL managed infrastructure.


6. ### Last Updated
   - Description: The date when the information for the road segment was last updated. This helps users assess the currency and relevance of the data.


7. ### Shape__Length
   - Description: The length of the road segment, measured in meters. This geometric attribute is crucial for spatial analysis and mapping.


### Dataset Access
