### 1.5 Background

Advancements in information technology have proven effective in addressing real-world problems, such as monitoring road traffic levels and determining the shortest travel routes. Maps are crucial for presenting and analyzing spatial distribution data across various sectors, including business, resources, and service needs. According to Woodbury, 85% of all computerized databases worldwide contain a location component like street addresses or zip codes. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology has emerged as one of the most significant research tools and rapidly growing high-tech solutions for data monitoring and management [1].

GIS technology integrates diverse datasets swiftly, enabling users to analyze and visualize information efficiently. In service management, GIS is used extensively to display large volumes of data relevant to local and regional planning activities [1]. Location and routing techniques in GIS support decision-making processes by presenting solutions clearly and allowing for process exploration, thus enabling informed judgments. Web-based architectures, such as the World Wide Web (WWW), facilitate deploying databases via the Internet, providing access to central data storage, remote data collection, and interaction between GIS and optimization software [2].

The motivation for this project arises from the need to provide accurate and effective information for road network analysis and traffic management. Road network analysis produces reliable information that aids decision-makers in selecting optimal routes through mathematical calculations and dynamic programming [3], [4]. Determining the optimal route is a common research topic in transportation literature, focusing on minimizing travel time and cost [5].

Effective traffic conditions management and accurate information provision are critical for monitoring road networks and navigation systems. This study aims to implement and evaluate a GIS-based methodology for determining optimal routes in road networks, utilizing key information based on the cost of distance. An integrated approach to location and routing, supported by a robust application, offers a significant competitive advantage. The project's goal is to develop a decision tool for monitoring road networks and facilitating efficient navigation within the University of Roehampton campus.

GIS technology in transport management has proven effective in analyzing road networks and optimizing routes. Chen [1] highlights the flexibility and power of GIS in various fields, including retail tourism and teaching curriculum. Calvoa et al. [2] demonstrate GIS's potential in solving daily carpooling problems. Boulaxis and Papadopoulos [3] highlight the use of dynamic programming techniques with GIS for optimal feeder routing in distribution systems. Monteiro et al. [4] illustrate the application of GIS spatial analysis in optimizing electric line routing, showcasing GIS's versatility in various optimization scenarios. Finally, Ahn and Rakha [5] explore the effects of route choice decisions on vehicle energy consumption and emissions, providing insights into the environmental benefits of optimal routing decisions.

Effective traffic management through advanced traffic forecasting and GIS technologies is essential for reducing economic losses and improving urban mobility. This project aims to leverage real-time data and Dijkstra algorithm to provide a comprehensive solution for traffic management in London and navigation within the University of Roehampton campus, significantly reducing travel time, fuel costs, and overall congestion, contributing to a more efficient and sustainable urban environment.

### 1.6 Structure of Report 

The report is organized into five chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project. Chapter 2: Literature and Technology Review provides a comprehensive review of existing literature and technologies relevant to traffic forecasting and road network optimization. Chapter 3: Implementation with Dijkstra's Algorithm details the methodology and steps taken to implement the project using Dijkstra's algorithm. Chapter 4: Evaluation and Results presents the evaluation of the implemented system and discusses the results obtained. Chapter 5: Conclusion summarizes the findings of the project and discusses its implications. 

### 2 Literature - Technology Review

Traffic congestion remains a significant issue, especially in urban areas [6x]. The primary cause is road congestion or exceeding road capacity, leading to a supply shortage and increased accidents and traffic jams [7x]. Inefficient vehicle routing and the waiting time at intersections, compared to travel time on road segments, also contribute to this problem [6x]. These challenges are often referred to as Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), a heavily researched topic in operations research due to the rising costs of emissions in recent years [8x]

### 2.1. Literature Review

### Path Planning
Extensive research has developed effective global path planning algorithms, including graph search, random sampling, and bionic algorithms. Notably, the Dijkstra Algorithm is a key method in graph search [9x], recognized for solving optimization problems, including path planning [10x]. Path planning algorithms are primarily divided into heuristic and optimal path planning. Optimal path planning techniques calculate all costs from one graph point to the next to determine the shortest route to each vertex [11x]. The shortest route problem involves finding the most direct path from a given starting point to a desired destination, typically represented in graph form [12x].

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826623fd-ab1c-4a37-bd82-4b904ff9c917)
### Fig. 1. Shortest path graph example



The optimal path planning algorithm explores all possible solutions to find the globally optimal path. Incremental graph algorithms can be integrated into optimal algorithms to enhance their efficiency. Conversely, heuristic path planning algorithms iteratively refine a subset of solutions, aiming for a feasible but potentially suboptimal outcome. Although these solutions are not guaranteed to be globally optimal, they often achieve comparable quality. Heuristic algorithms require a destination point to begin the process [11x].

### Routing Algorithms
Numerous vehicle routing algorithms exist, including Bellman-Ford, Floyd Warshall, and the A* search algorithm [3X]. However, the Dijkstra Algorithm stands out as the most well-known and fastest labeling technique [13X]. Developed by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Wybe Dijkstra in 1959 [14X], it is a greedy algorithm that determines the shortest route between an origin node and a destination vertex [15X]. According to Suardinata et al., the Dijkstra algorithm finds the minimum length from vertex a to z in a weighted graph with positive weights, as negative nodes cannot be used [16X]. The key concepts include:
- The length of a trajectory in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights, denoted by .
- The shortest path from initial node  to end node  is the path with the minimum length, expressed as  if there are m different paths.
The algorithm is briefly represented as , where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges [17X].
Dijkstra initiated research in grid-map-based path planning by examining the shortest path between two nodes on a map [18x]. The Dijkstra Algorithm, a graph search method, efficiently determines the shortest paths between two points [19x]. This approach is particularly useful for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem. Road networks are modeled using graph theory, where intersections are represented as nodes connected by edges, with cost values assigned from departure to destination. Computer algorithms then efficiently find vehicle routes within this framework [4x].
Dijkstra's method employs a priority queue to trace the highest-priority point. It assigns values to each point and maintains these values until the inspection point is reached, allowing comparison with newly determined route values [10x]. 
The advantage of using the Dijkstra Algorithm is that it requires every edge's weight to be non-negative; otherwise, the path cannot be accurately followed, leading to incorrect results. The algorithm starts from the initial point, expanding outward in layers until the target node is found [20x]. 
The Dijkstra algorithm is commonly used in real-time applications, such as geographic mapping, for optimal path planning, including considerations like traffic light durations. Additional research has integrated the time dimension into the algorithm [21x].

### 2.2. Technology Review

### Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and Its Relevance
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, introduced by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1959, is a seminal method for finding the shortest paths in a graph [4, 5]. Extensively utilized in transportation networks, computer science, and urban planning, it calculates the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative weights, making it ideal for road networks. Studies highlight its effectiveness in optimizing routes. For example, Botsis and Panagiotopoulos applied it at the International Hellenic University in Serres, Greece, finding the shortest routes between campus locations [2]. Their findings confirm the algorithm's efficiency in solving complex routing problems, motivating its use in traffic forecasting and navigation.

### Choosing Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm over Bellman-Ford
The Bellman-Ford algorithm, developed by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr., calculates shortest paths in a graph and can handle graphs with negative edge weights. However, its higher time complexity (O(|E||V|)) makes it less efficient than Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(|E| log |V|). Given the extensive and complex road network of London and the University of Roehampton, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm's efficiency makes it a more practical choice.
While Bellman-Ford's ability to handle negative weights is advantageous in certain scenarios, this feature is unnecessary for navigating Londonâ€™s road network, where negative edge weights do not exist. Therefore, the additional complexity of Bellman-Ford is unwarranted for this application.

#### Practical Applications of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm has been successfully employed in various practical scenarios, such as optimizing urban rail networks and facilitating building evacuations, demonstrating its versatility and reliability [2].These applications underscore the algorithm's suitability for traffic forecasting in road networks, including the complex and dynamic environment of Londonâ€™s road infrastructure.

### Limitations of Existing Navigation Tools
Current navigation tools, such as Google Maps, provide broad route planning services but often fall short in specific contexts, such as University of Roehampton campuses or intricate urban road networks[2, 5]. These tools may not always provide the most optimal routes or account for all the nuances of local road layouts .

This research aims to address these limitations by implementing a tailored approach using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, specifically designed for the navigation needs of Londonâ€™s road network and the University of Roehampton. By integrating on-site drone surveys for precise data collection and employing advanced software tools, the proposed system aims to deliver an efficient and user-friendly navigation solution.

### Advancing Current Research
The study builds on previous research, such as the work by Botsis and Panagiotopoulos, which applied Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to campus navigation [2]. By densifying the graph model and developing a web application, this research seeks to enhance user experience and improve the routing algorithm's effectiveness. This focused approach aims to fill existing gaps and extend the applicability of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to more complex and dynamic traffic forecasting scenarios within road networks.

### 2.4. Summary of Technology and Literature Review and Objectives

### Findings:
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Proven effective for finding shortest paths in graphs. Ideal for navigation in complex environments like university campuses and road networks [4, 5].

Goal: To reduce traffic congestion and enhance campus navigation through an optimized, tailored navigation system.


### Chapter 3 Implementation

To enhance road routing and navigation in London, especially within the University of Roehampton, a traffic forecasting system is proposed to avoid inefficiencies and traffic jams. The system's architecture, depicted in Fig.1, comprises three main elements: a server, a database, and the users.


### 3.1 System's Architecture

### A.Geographic Information System(GIS)

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been advancing since the 1970s. GIS serves as a crucial tool for location mapping, visualizing dynamic conditions, and aiding decision-making processes [6-8]. Geospatial data are instrumental in monitoring responses to accidents. During the response phase, GIS enables the analysis of real-time data, facilitating visualization and automation for more efficient decision-making. Research in GIS has concentrated on areas like shortest path analysis [9, 10]. This highlights the significant potential of GIS applications to reduce response times if geospatial information is utilized at the initial stages of accident response.


### B. Web Service
A web service is an internet-based technology defined by the W3C as "a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network" [11].


### C. Web GIS
Web GIS initially offered only client access through browsers, incorporating basic GIS functions to minimize system costs. Browsers are an optimal choice because they can extensively utilize GIS, reduce software expenses, simplify operations, and provide a user-friendly interface [12, 13].

D.  System Component
The web framework is based on a three-tier architecture consisting of the client layer, middleware layer, and database layer. These components provide a unified interface for data consultation, requests, and decision-making. The PostgreSQL database, enhanced with PostGIS, supports both relational and spatial queries. Users interact with the database via the Internet, using a web browser for navigation and spatial analysis. User requests are processed by the Apache Web Server and passed to the GIS server, which queries the database[14]. The system supports system administrators, who manage databases, and teleoperators, who handle data entry, editing, and deletion through a GUI. The system utilizes geographic data for mapping and semantic data for routing and traffic flow information.

### B. Backend Development
The backend will be developed to manage data processing, implement pathfinding algorithms, and handle database interactions. This will involve setting up servers and API endpoints to facilitate secure and efficient data transactions. The backend infrastructure will be designed to support real-time data updates, query execution, and integration with the frontend, ensuring a seamless user experience. By focusing on robust server architecture and optimized data handling, the backend will enable efficient processing of spatial data, accurate route calculations, and reliable communication with the database, ultimately enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the navigation system.

### C. Web Development
A web interface using React will be developed to display optimal routes on a digital map of London. This interface will be designed for accessibility via computers, ensuring ease of use for all campus members. The goal is to provide an interactive and responsive experience, allowing users to view and interact with real-time traffic data and optimal routes efficiently. The web application will feature intuitive navigation, real-time updates, and user-friendly design elements, making it a valuable tool for navigating the campus and surrounding areas. By leveraging React's capabilities, the interface will offer a seamless and engaging user experience.

### D. Integration of Custom Tile Map Service

The application will integrate a custom tile map service to provide high-resolution drone imagery, ensuring seamless and efficient map rendering. This integration will enhance user interaction by offering detailed and accurate visual representations of the area. The high-resolution imagery will facilitate better route visualization and navigation, improving the overall user experience. By utilizing a custom tile map service, the application will maintain fast loading times and smooth performance, allowing users to interact with the map effortlessly and access up-to-date visual information with ease. This feature will significantly enhance the application's functionality and appeal.

### 3.4  Implementation
The chosen tools are open-source solutions like MapServer, Leaflet, and PostgreSQL, which provide functionalities comparable to commercial options but at a reduced setup cost. This application is designed with the assumption that users (decision-makers) lack a background in modeling or implementation. Therefore, the information presented to them is straightforward and user-friendly, avoiding technical or conceptual details.

To develop the application, an Object-Oriented (OO) methodology, SQL, GO Language, and JavaScript were employed. The application features a main window where all functionalities are accessible via a toolbar or menu, making it easy for users to navigate.

The target users are decision-makers with moderate computer skills, emphasizing the need for an intuitive interface. The tool is divided into two subsystems:
- A subsystem for entering location name, editing, or delete road network data
- A subsystem for managing geographic data display

The tool includes a set of graphical user interfaces and is designed for web platforms. Its open architecture facilitates the easy addition of new functionalities.

A. Graphical User Interface (GUl) 

The primary goal of the GUI was to facilitate easy and efficient access. According to [15], the following characteristics are essential:

- Easy to learn: Ensures that any user can intuitively use the tool.
- Robustness: Allows users to recover from unintended situations.
- Interactivity: Enables effective information flow between the user and the system.
- Event-based: Keeps users constantly aware of the tasks they are performing.

### B.  Tools
The semantic database is managed by the PostgreSQL database management system. Graphic layers obtained with GIS from the digitization of University of Roehampton routes and the London road network are imported into the Oracle spatial DBMS: PostGIS. Utilizing this Oracle spatial DBMS allows interaction with the mapping module of the web server: Leaflet.

### C.Decision Model 
The web serves as the primary interface for connecting users to the system. The teleoperator uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to simplify the interpretation of information, enabling them to (Figure 6):
- Control Layers: Toggle the visibility of certain layers.
- Map Operations: Perform actions like zooming in, zooming out, expanding, planning, and querying specific areas of the map to gain a better understanding of the data in those regions.
- Focus on London: Directly center on the London road networks.
- Scale Visualization: View the map at different scales by changing the representation scale.
- Map Reference: Display a reference map for easier location identification.
- Full Caption Layers: Show comprehensive caption layers.
- Database Query: Utilize drop-down lists and checkboxes to query the database, or directly use SQL (Structured Query Language) statements for a combination of relational and spatial queries.
- Spatial Queries: Perform spatial queries in various ways, such as clicking the search box to query map objects or by entering the identifier, designation, or X and Y coordinates of a post, with results transmitted to the user as an XML document via the web.

### 3.5  Implementation of Dikstralâ€™s Algorithm 

### A.    Dijkstra's algorithm
Incorporating an efficient shortest-path algorithm within the GIS will reduce time spent on the road network and address navigation inefficiencies. The optimal routes are those with the minimum required transportation times. A real-time system must be capable of providing prompt responses to such queries. 

In the London Navigator, the experimental system developed for this project, the routing service is implemented using Dijkstra's algorithm. This spatial optimization algorithm is widely used in GIS software for finding the shortest routes. Its performance relies on the data structures used to implement the graph representing the spatial network [16]. The road network is represented by a graph (non-oriented in this case), where each intersection on the physical road is depicted as a node.
Let G = (N, A) be a graph consisting of a set of nodes (N) and a set of arcs (A), each with a non-negative cost C. This graph is designed for tracing the least-cost path (route) in G. For a given destination node in the network, Dijkstra's algorithm calculates the least accumulated cost between the destination node and every other node, then finds the least-cost path from any origin node to the destination node. The logical procedure of Dijkstra's algorithm is as follows [17]:
1. Let the node at which we are starting be called the source node. Assign to the source node an initial value of zero and to all other nodes an initial value of infinity. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set the source node as current.
2. For the current node, consider its unvisited neighbors directly connected by links having cost values and calculate their accumulated costs from the source node. If the new accumulated cost is less than the previously recorded cost, overwrite the cost.
3. When all neighbors directly connected to the current node are completely considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again, ensuring its accumulated distance is final and minimal.
4. If all nodes have been visited, finish. Otherwise, set the unvisited node with the least accumulated cost to the source node as the next "current node" and continue from step 2.

Dijkstra's algorithm is very similar to the A* algorithm. The cost function c used to evaluate shortest paths in the Dijkstra algorithm is augmented by an estimator function, which estimates the shortest path between two given graph nodes. This is represented as c(s, d) = g(s, v) + h(v, d), where g(s, v) is the cost from source s to v, and h(v, d) is the heuristic estimated cost from v to the destination d. The estimator function is a heuristic that can be chosen arbitrarily. If the estimator function is 0, A* turns into Dijkstra's algorithm [18].

### B.  Simulated test cases and routing

The algorithm was implemented in Python within a web environment hosted on [Render](https://render.com), which manages the backend, including the database and server operations. Render not only facilitates the handling of road maps online through user-friendly interfaces, but also supports the implementation of the "pgrouting" plugin, which runs on both the client and server sides. The frontend, responsible for the user interface, was hosted on Netlify and developed using Go language. The interface is designed with an intuitive template for easy and effortless use, as illustrated in the provided image[figure 6].
Users can view specific locations on the map by entering the name of the location. Additionally, they can determine the shortest route to a destination by specifying the starting and ending points. The algorithm then computes and displays the shortest route on the map. Whenever a routing operation is performed, the location names are passed as parameters from the client interface to the server. The server connects to the database, processes the request, computes the shortest path between the specified points, and highlights it on the map with a distinct color, see figure 7.

Figure 8. The proposed routing solution with Dijkstra's algorithm.

### I. Test Case 1: Routing Problem at the University of Roehampton

In this scenario, we have a user named Aman Richard, a 29-year-old MSc Data Science student at the University of Roehampton, London. Aman resides at Southlands Chapel, located within the university campus. One day, he decided to go for a workout at the university gym. His fellow student recommended the Oliver Garnet-ROEactive Gym, which is situated on campus. However, Aman was unfamiliar with its exact location.

To solve this problem, Aman decided to use the "London Navigator," a tool recommended by his peer for optimizing the shortest routes on London roads, including those within the University of Roehampton campus. Using the system, Aman entered his starting point (Southlands Chapel) and his desired destination (Oliver Garnet-ROEactive Gym). The system quickly computed and provided the shortest route, complete with clear path-guiding hints displayed on the map.

Figure 9. Southlands Chapel to Oliver Garnet-ROEactive Gym 

### II. Test Case 2: Locating a Lecture Class Building at the University of Roehampton

this scenario, Dr. John Carter, a newly employed lecturer at the University of Roehampton, faces a challenge. On his first day, Dr. Carter arrives at the university's main entrance, ready to deliver a lecture. However, he struggles to locate the Sir David Bell Building, where his lecture is scheduled to take place. Unfortunately, Google Maps does not provide the precise location of this building within the campus.
To resolve this issue, Dr. Carter decides to use the "London Navigator," a tool designed for optimizing routes both within London and specifically on the University of Roehampton campus. At the main entrance, Dr. Carter inputs his current location and sets the Sir David Bell Building as his desired destination.
The London Navigator quickly calculates the shortest route, providing Dr. Carter with a clear and detailed path to follow. Thanks to the accurate guidance from the system, Dr. Carter is able to navigate through the campus and arrive at the Sir David Bell Building promptly, ensuring that he is on time for his lecture.
This case highlights the effectiveness of the London Navigator in addressing routing challenges that conventional map services, like Google Maps, may not fully support within specialized environments such as a university campus, see figure 9.

Figure 10. University of Roehampton Main Entrance to Sir David Bell Building

### III. Test Case 3: Delivering Pizza to the University of Roehampton
In this scenario, Tom Bennett, a dispatch delivery man, is tasked with delivering a pizza to a student waiting at the main entrance gate of the University of Roehampton. Tom is currently in Putney, a nearby area, and needs to find the quickest and most efficient route to the university's main entrance.

To ensure timely delivery, Tom decides to use the "London Navigator," a specialized tool designed to optimize routes within London, including routes leading to the University of Roehampton. Tom inputs his current location in Putney as the starting point and the University of Roehampton main entrance gate as his destination.
The London Navigator promptly calculates the shortest route, offering precise turn-by-turn directions. This guidance allows Tom to avoid potential traffic delays and navigate directly to the university with ease. As a result, he is able to deliver the pizza to the student on time, ensuring customer satisfaction.

This scenario demonstrates the utility of the London Navigator in aiding delivery personnel by providing them with the most efficient routes, particularly when conventional navigation tools might not offer the same level of detail or accuracy for specific locations, see figure 10.

### Chapter 4 Evaluation and Result
To validate the effectiveness of the designed traffic forecasting system, a demonstration was conducted using a web-based client interface. This interface serves as a proof of concept and can be adapted for end-user applications, such as mobile apps, web browser extensions, or integrations with GPS navigation platforms. The client interface grants access to the userâ€™s geolocation and allows for the creation of a route by specifying either the current location or a different starting point, along with the desired destination.
The system dynamically generates a route based on the real-time traffic situation at the moment of the request, integrating google map API to forecast potential congestion by impementing dijkstra algorithm. The generated route aims to minimize travel time by choosing the optimal path under current and predicted traffic conditions. Initially, the system was trained using a manually set historical dataset to simulate traffic conditions and refine the the routing by digitising some missing network link within the system.

One of the system's key features is its ability to adapt to changing traffic conditions during a trip. If the traffic situation alters while the driver is on the road, the system can recalculate the route in real time to maintain the shortest possible travel time. The accuracy of the forecasts is continually evaluated by comparing predicted traffic conditions with the actual outcomes. This feedback mechanism allows the system to learn and improve its predictive accuracy over time, ultimately enhancing route optimization to achieve reduced travel times and alleviate congestion.
To quantify traffic congestion, the system utilized the condition 14â‰¤ n â‰¤ 20 for d = 60, where n is the number of vehicles and d represents the length of the road segment under study. This criterion assumes that a traffic jam forms when there are between 14 and 20 vehicles within a 60-meter stretch of road.
Additionally, the system leveraged the Google Maps API to calculate the number of markers (vehicles) in a specific neighborhood of the London road network. This data on inflow and outflow across the network aids in forecasting routes that result in reduced travel times. The application of this system within the London road network, including the University of Roehampton area, demonstrated its potential to optimize routes, thereby contributing to a more efficient transportation system.

To numerically assess the benefits of the designed traffic forecasting system, the system was tested on approximately 10 different routes under varying traffic conditions, including scenarios with different levels of congestion. The evaluation aimed to quantify the time savings achieved by using the forecasting system compared to not using it.
The following metrics were used:
- t1: Time required to complete the route without using the traffic forecasting system.
- t2: Time required to complete the route using the traffic forecasting system.
- Î”t: The time difference between completing the route without and with the forecasting system, expressed as a percentage.
Î”t =  ..........................................................................(1)

The above calculations demonstrate the efficiency of using the developed system of road traffic forecasting, namely, the following gains in time from 25% to 40% (average values). 
Nodes	Routes	Total Time with Routing System	Total Time without Routing System
N1-N2	Acton- Algate	20	25
N2-N1	Algate- Acton	18	27

The selected test cases included routes with both minimum and maximum time gains. These cases illustrated the variability in the system's performance, depending on the severity of traffic congestion. In scenarios with heavy congestion, the time savings were more pronounced, demonstrating the system's capacity to significantly reduce travel times by predicting and avoiding traffic jams.
In summary, the evaluation confirmed that the traffic forecasting system consistently provided time savings, with the magnitude of these savings dependent on the traffic conditions encountered on each route. This demonstrates the practical value of the system in real-world applications, offering potential improvements in commute efficiency and reductions in overall travel time.

4.1Related Works 
In the domain of traffic forecasting and route optimization, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of transportation systems. A noteworthy contribution is the work by Souad El Houssaini and Abdelmajid Sadri, titled "A Web-Based Spatial Decision Support System for Effective Monitoring and Routing Problem." Their research presents an integrated framework that leverages Geographic Information Systems (GIS) combined with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to improve the monitoring and management of road networks[44] .
El Houssaini and Sadri's system utilizes GIS technology to collect and analyze geographic data related to road networks and monitoring stations. Their framework not only identifies optimal routes based on minimum cost using Dijkstra's algorithm but also supports the strategic placement and orientation of monitoring stations in response to road incidents. The integration of diverse datasets and advanced information retrieval within a GIS environment demonstrates the system's potential to manage complex spatial data and optimize routing decisions effectively.

The effectiveness of their system was tested on the road network of Mohammedia City in Morocco, where it demonstrated significant improvements in response to road accidents through simulated test cases. The proposed system, described as scalable and well-structured, serves as a comprehensive tool for traffic monitoring and routing, particularly in scenarios requiring rapid and efficient intervention.
When compared to the current project on traffic forecasting and route optimization in London and the University of Roehampton, El Houssaini and Sadri's work offers valuable insights into the use of GIS and algorithmic methods for managing and optimizing road networks. While their research focuses on the integration of GIS with RDBMS and the application of Dijkstra's algorithm for routing, the current project builds on these methodologies by incorporating real-time traffic data and Google Maps API. This extension aims to dynamically predict traffic patterns and optimize routes, addressing the specific challenges of London's intricate road network.
Another significant contribution to the field is a study presented at the 1st International Conference of Information Technology to Enhance E-Learning and Other Applications (IT-ELA 2020), hosted by Baghdad College of Economic Sciences University. This study explored the application of parallel computation methods to solve the shortest path problem in vehicular networks [45].
In their paper titled "A Parallel Implementation Method for Solving the Shortest Path Problem for Vehicular Networks," Emad H. Al-Hemiary and Salim A. Mohammed Ali from Al-Nahrain University in Baghdad, Iraq, investigated the complexities of finding the shortest paths in mobile and densely populated vehicular networks. The authors applied Hedetniemi's Algorithm, a well-known method for calculating multi-source multi-destination shortest paths, and enhanced its computational efficiency using OpenCL (Open Compute Language).
Their research demonstrated a substantial acceleration in path calculation, achieving a 40x speedup when utilizing parallel computation compared to a sequential approach. This acceleration was particularly evident when handling high-dimensional input data, making the system more responsive and scalable for real-world applications. This study highlights the importance of leveraging parallel computing techniques to address the computational challenges inherent in vehicular networks, a goal that aligns closely with the objectives of the traffic forecasting system developed in the current research.
These related works underscore the ongoing advancements in traffic management and the potential of integrating advanced computation methods and real-time data to further optimize route planning systems. Such innovations contribute significantly to the overall efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation networks.

###  Chapter 5  Conclusion 

The "London Navigator" system, designed for traffic forecasting and route optimization within the London road network, including the University of Roehampton, has proven to be an effective tool for addressing specific routing challenges that conventional map services may not fully support. Through a series of test cases, the system demonstrated its capability to provide precise and efficient route guidance in scenarios that involved navigating within complex environments like university campuses, see [ Appendix C 1] for more details.

Test Case 1 highlighted the system's effectiveness in helping Aman Richard, an MSc Data Science student, navigate from Southlands Chapel to the Oliver Garnet-ROEactive Gym within the University of Roehampton. The London Navigator successfully provided a short and clear route, overcoming the limitations of conventional tools like Google Maps, which struggled to recognize specific campus locations. This case illustrated the system's practical value in enhancing campus navigation.

Test Case 2 involved Dr. John Carter, a new lecturer at the University of Roehampton, who needed to locate the Sir David Bell Building for his lecture. The London Navigator again proved its effectiveness by quickly guiding him through the campus, ensuring he arrived at his destination on time. This case emphasized the system's utility for university staff and visitors, ensuring timely and accurate navigation across the campus.
Test Case 3 demonstrated the system's broader applicability by assisting Tom Bennett, a delivery man, in finding the quickest route from Putney to the University of Roehampton's main entrance. The London Navigator enabled Tom to avoid traffic delays by choosing route that is not congested and deliver his pizza on time, underscoring the system's relevance for logistics and delivery services operating within the London area.

The system's effectiveness was further validated through a rigorous evaluation process, where it consistently provided time savings, particularly in scenarios with heavy traffic congestion. The test results confirmed that the London Navigator could significantly reduce travel times by dynamically predicting traffic patterns and optimizing routes. The system's integration with real-time traffic data and its use of advanced algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, allowed it to outperform conventional navigation tools, particularly in specialized environments.

In conclusion, the London Navigator represents a significant advancement in traffic forecasting and route optimization within urban settings. Its ability to adapt to real-time traffic conditions and its successful application in diverse test cases within the University of Roehampton highlight its potential as a valuable tool for improving navigation efficiency in complex environments. The system not only offers practical benefits for everyday users but also contributes to reducing congestion and improving overall transportation efficiency within the London road network.


### Future Work

Building on the successful implementation and evaluation of the London Navigator system, several enhancements are planned to expand its functionality and further improve its effectiveness in real-world applications.
One of the key areas for future development is the integration of GPS capabilities into the system. By incorporating GPS technology, the London Navigator can be transformed into a robust device tracker, allowing users to monitor the real-time location of their devices within the network. This feature would be particularly useful for applications such as fleet management, where it is crucial to track the location and movement of vehicles to optimize routes and improve overall efficiency.
Another significant enhancement involves the addition of a feature to identify congested regions within the network. The system will be upgraded to provide real-time indications of traffic congestion, enabling users to visualize problem areas on the map. Alongside this, the system will suggest alternative routes to help users navigate around congested zones effectively. This feature aims to reduce travel times further and alleviate traffic congestion by guiding users away from high-traffic areas and onto less congested paths.
These planned enhancements will significantly extend the utility of the London Navigator, making it not only a powerful tool for route optimization but also an essential asset for real-time traffic management and device tracking. The integration of GPS and the ability to indicate and avoid congested regions will ensure that the system remains at the forefront of urban traffic management solutions, offering users a comprehensive and adaptable tool for navigating complex road networks.



### 5.2  Reflection

Working on this project has been a deeply rewarding experience, offering both challenges and opportunities for growth. The process of developing the London Navigator system not only allowed me to explore an area of personal interest but also significantly expanded my technical skills and knowledge in the field of traffic forecasting and route optimization.
One of the most valuable aspects of this project was the hands-on experience I gained with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools, particularly QGIS. Through this, I learned how to digitize road networks, a critical skill that enabled me to construct accurate representations of London's complex road system. This experience was pivotal in laying the foundation for the project, as it allowed for the precise mapping of routes and the integration of real-time traffic data.


I also acquired practical knowledge in graph construction using data from Transport for London (TfL). This involved creating a network model that could be efficiently navigated by algorithms, further deepening my understanding of the underlying structures that drive traffic management systems. Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm on the London road network was another significant milestone in this project. This task challenged me to apply theoretical concepts in a practical context, enhancing my problem-solving skills and reinforcing my understanding of algorithmic efficiency.

The project goals were met largely because of my passion for this area of study. My previous work on a smaller-scale project in the same domain provided a strong foundation, enabling me to expand the scope to a larger network system with confidence. This continuity allowed me to build on my earlier successes and apply lessons learned to this more ambitious undertaking.
In hindsight, while I am pleased with the outcomes, there are a few aspects I would approach differently if given the chance. Although the project was successful, I realized that more extensive initial planning around data acquisition and integration could have streamlined some of the later stages of the project. Additionally, incorporating user feedback earlier in the development process might have helped refine the user interface and overall functionality of the system.





































### Specific Example with Three Road Structures

Consider three road structures: Watford Way, Colchester Road, and Western Avenue, with the following travel scenarios:

-Two cars traveling from Watford Way to Colchester Road:
  * Represented by edges  and 
  
- One car traveling from Colchester Road to Colchester Road:
  * Represented by edge 

In this example:
- The vertices are the road structures (Watford Way, Colchester Road, and Western Avenue).
- The directed edges (e.g. , ,, ) represent the travel paths between these road structures.
- The weight of each edge is the travel time between the corresponding roads.


120	140	150	Road
7:40	7:55		Watford Way
7:55	8:05	8:15	Colchester Road 
		8:30	Western Avenue

### Network Representation
The graph representing the London road network is illustrated in Figure 2.4. Here, the vertices correspond to different road structures, and the edges represent the connecting roads with travel times as their weights.

### Path Example
Consider the path:
- Watford Way > Colchester Road > Western Avenue

This path involves traveling:
- From Watford Way  to Colchester Road via edge  (10 minutes)
- From Colchester Road to Western Avenue via edge  (15 minutes)

Thus, the total time spent in the cars is 10 + 15 = 25 minutes.

However, this does not represent the actual trip duration. The trip took 35 minutes because of a 10-minute traffic wait at Colchester Road.

### Explanation of Waiting Time
The waiting time occurs due to the discrete nature of road connections. Unlike an escalator, where movement is continuous, traffic involves specific, discrete times for getting on and off roads. Consequently, time is lost in the gaps between arrival and departure of connections.

- Total trip time: 35 minutes
  - Time spent in cars: 25 minutes
  - Waiting time at Colchester Road: 10 minutes

This example highlights how travel times in a network can be affected by waiting times due to traffic and connection schedules.


### 2.4. Representing Waiting Time

To accurately reflect the total duration of a trip, including waiting times, it is suggested that the waiting time be incorporated into the path length. Some researchers recommend adding an average waiting time to the travel time, as noted in sources such as [14]. For instance, if traffic moves on and off every 10 minutes, an average waiting time of 5 minutes would be included in the travel time.

However, even when the waiting time is conservatively estimated, this method only provides an approximate trip duration. It does not offer precise departure or arrival times. This approach may be suitable for stochastic applications, like capacity planning or passenger flow models, where an average travel time is adequate. Nonetheless, it falls short when specific travel information is necessary.

### Alternative Representation of Waiting Time

An alternative method to represent waiting time is to create two vertices for each station: one for arriving cars and one for departing cars. These vertices are connected by an edge that represents the waiting time. However, determining the length of this waiting edge in advance is challenging because the waiting time depends on the route taken.

Consider the example illustrated in Figure 2.5. How long should the edge be that connects the inflow of Colchester Road to the outflow of Colchester Road? If the arrival was by car 120, the waiting time would be 20 minutes; if by car 140, it would be 10 minutes.

This issue can be resolved by adding one vertex for each arriving car and one vertex for each departing car. A vertex representing an arriving car at a road is connected to a vertex representing a departing car from that road by a waiting edge, provided there is sufficient connection time. The length of the waiting edge corresponds to the specific waiting time.

In this refined model, as shown in Figure 2.6, each arriving car has its own vertex, and each departing car has its own vertex, with edges representing the waiting times between them. This method ensures that the traffic waiting times are accurately reflected based on the actual arrival and departure schedules.

### 2.5. A Discrete Network

To efficiently and accurately represent discrete connections, a discrete network is proposed. In such a network, the discreteness of connections is reflected in the properties of the edges. A discrete network consists of a finite, weighted, directed graph G = (V, E). Additionally, each edge e in E is associated with two values:
1. start(e): The start value.
2. end(e): The end value, where start(e) < end(e).

The length of an edge e is defined as:
l(e) = end(e) - start(e)

In representing a road network, each car departing from a road is depicted by one edge. The start and end values of the edge correspond to the departure and arrival times of the car. The length of the edge represents the car's travel time.

For instance, in the example provided, if start   is 8:15 and end  is 8:30, then the length  is 15 minutes. This example is illustrated in Figure 2.7.


### Path Length and Connection Cost in a Discrete Network

A path P is represented as a sequence of edges ,,...., . The length of a path P, denoted as l(P), is defined as:

 l(P) = end(P) - start(P)

In a road network, the start and end values of a path correspond to the departure and arrival times, respectively, and the length of the path represents the duration of the trip. For example, considering the path illustrated in Figure 2.7, if the path consists of edges   and   \), the length of the path is:
8:30 - 7:55 = 35 minutes
representing the actual travel time. If the path consists of edges   and , the length becomes: 8:30 - 7:40 = 50  minutes

Fig.2.7.




A connection along the path is defined as a pair of edges { , }, such that the end vertex of  is the start vertex of . In a road network, a connection corresponds to a pair of connecting road structure, possibly involving a route change. The cost of a connection along the path P, denoted as COST, is defined as:
COST(, ) = start}() - end() for  0 â‰¤ k < n.

In the context of a road network system, the COST of a connection represents the waiting time of the within the road. The following conditions apply:
(1). The end vertex of  is the start vertex of , for 0 â‰¤ k < n.
(2). end() â‰¤ start(), for 0 â‰¤ k < n.

The start and end of a path P are defined as:
start(P) = start}() 
end(P) = end()
