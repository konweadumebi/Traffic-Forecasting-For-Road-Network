### INTRODUCTION

The coming of the intelligent transport system has pointed out the critical necessity of accurate traffic forecasting. With advancements in machine learning technology, the objectives of this project include advanced machine learning for effectively predicting traffic jams, the shortest or fastest route by using the historical data of the road with respect to given time, that can significantly increase the efficiency of road network management. The project is also motivated by increased congestion and growing pressure on the demand for real-time traffic management solutions. Therefore, Traffic prediction is a critical ingredient in the modern urban planning field and traffic management. These factors further extend the problems for traffic management in a more significant way in many cities worldwide. A good traffic forecasting system may lessen these burdens, as it provides valuable information about traffic control, route planning, and congestion management. This is the reason behind this application, a System that give the shortest route to users destination and serves as path finder within University of Roehampton London Campus, it will help anyone within the campus to easily locate where they want to go.


### Transport network analysis
A transport network, also known as a transportation network, is a system or graph within a geographic space that outlines the infrastructure enabling and limiting movement or flow.[1] Examples encompass road networks, railways, air routes, pipelines, aqueducts, and power lines. Digitally representing these networks and the techniques for their examination are fundamental to spatial analysis, geographic information systems, public utilities, and transport engineering. Network analysis applies the theories and algorithms of graph theory and constitutes a type of proximity analysis.

### Flow Network
In graph theory, a flow network, also referred to as a transportation network, is a directed graph where each edge has a designated capacity and carries a specific flow. The flow on any given edge cannot exceed its capacity. In operations research, this directed graph is typically called a network, with vertices termed nodes and edges termed arcs. A flow network must adhere to the rule that the total flow into a node equals the total flow out, except for a source node, which only has outgoing flow, or a sink node, which only has incoming flow. Such networks can model various systems, including traffic in computer networks, circulation with demands, fluids in pipes, electrical currents, or any scenario where something moves through a network of nodes.
A network is a directed graph \( G = (V, E) \) characterized by a non-negative capacity function \( c \) for each edge, with no multiple arcs (i.e., no two edges share the same source and target nodes). Typically, it is assumed that if \( (u, v) \in E \), then \( (v, u) \) is also in \( E \). If \( (v, u) \notin E \), we can add \( (v, u) \) to \( E \) and set \( c(v, u) = 0 \).

When two nodes in \( G \) are specified—one as the source \( s \) and the other as the sink \( t \)—the tuple \( (G, c, s, t) \) is referred to as a flow network.
