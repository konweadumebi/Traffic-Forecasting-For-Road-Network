###Abstract
Traffic congestion in London leads to significant time delays and economic losses, while navigating specific locations, such as the University of Roehampton campus, poses challenges, particularly for newcomers. These issues affect a wide range of users, including commuters, drivers, students, staff, and visitors. Addressing these challenges is crucial to enhancing quality of life, reducing travel costs, and improving the efficiency of transportation systems.

### Introduction
Traffic congestion and navigation inefficiency are pressing issues in metropolitan areas such as London. Addressing these challenges can save time and reduce economic losses significantly. According to the INRIX 2022 Global Traffic Scorecard, London is the most congested city globally, with drivers losing an average of 156 hours in traffic annually. In the UK, the average driver lost 80 hours to congestion, reflecting a 7-hour increase from 2021, though still 35 hours less than in 2019. The annual cost of congestion in London amounted to £1,377 per driver, with UK drivers losing an average of £707. Additionally, rising fuel costs added £212 for London commuters and £122 nationally [1].
